          AITA for only having my bio sister in my wedding party and not
          including any step or half siblings even with offers to pay?

          I (27m) am getting married to my fianc√©e Millie (27f) in a few months.
          Millie's amazing and because of her we have everything planned fast
          which is why this is a topic of discussion now. So I asked my sister
          India (26f) and my best friend/future BIL (when he marries India)
          Ryder (27m) to be my groomspeople. India is technically my best person
          but they're sharing everything since it's just the two of them. Millie
          asked her three best friends to be her bridespeople which includes a
          guy best friend. Because I asked India and Millie asked a guy best
          friend to be in our direct wedding parties, my stepfamilies are having
          a field day over me asking India but none of my step or half siblings.

          My parents are divorced. Both remarried. My stepfather and mother have
          a toxic on and off relationship. He has three kids from before they
          met, two from after, and they have two together. For the last 9 years
          they have been a little more solid and no breakups. Still toxic. My
          stepmother is a c*nt and I hate the woman, so does India. There's
          little to no relationship with her judgemental ass. She had two sons
          before she met my dad. She and my dad have five more children
          together. Of all "the siblings" I only give a shit about India. The
          others aren't to blame for the shitshow the parents created but I was
          never close to any of them, and there's no bond. So I don't plan to
          give them any jobs at the wedding. They're guests and nothing more.
          Same for both my parents and their spouses. Some of the step and half
          siblings are upset, hurt, angry or offended at not being included in
          the wedding party. Especially my stepmother's two sons, they feel like
          they're the more obvious choice over India for being dudes. 
          
          But some of the girls are also just like, if India can do it why not them as
          well. I have made it clear nobody else is being asked. My stepfather
          told me he'd pay for me to include all his kids and I said no. Dad
          offered to pay for the wedding reception if I asked all the "siblings"
          on his side. Answer was also no. Mom told me they would gift us a
          honeymoon or whatever we want for their side and again no. Stepmother
          called me a dick and told me to think of etiquette and social
          standing. I told her to fuck off with her social standing. I don't
          give a shit about it. She called me vulgar. I said they can't buy
          people into the wedding. I was told by several of the people involved
          that I'm excluding family, harming family harmony (there is none and
          never was) and I should think of the younger kids especially and how
          sad they'll be to not be counted as a sibling during the wedding when
          only India is involved. I asked my mom and dad if they really wanted
          their younger kids and stepkids included by force when none of them
          are wanted in the wedding. 
          
          I asked was that really what they were going for. They were both angry at me for describing it that way.
          Which maybe was too harsh but no less true. Eloping is not what Millie
          and I want, which I know will be suggested. AITA?
